ETL Wiz Roadmap

This is obviously very high-level, and there'll doubtless be lots of bug-fixes
along the way.

<0.1: still coding - do not attempt to use!

0.1: Extract from CSV and write to one or more CSV.  Simple mapping language
     (probably just column assignment and maybe NULL-mapping to begin with).
     Get basic code implemented and working.
0.2: Extract from CSV and write to MySQL.
0.3: Enhance mapping language to that described in mapping_language.txt
0.4: Extract from MySQL and write to MySQL.
0.5: Extract from Postgres and write to MySQL, and vice-versa
