The first version of the etl mapping language will be a LISP-ish language

Why?  Because they're super-easy to parse.
Depending on how things go, I may or may not do an infix form of the
language later.

Functions will be of the form 

(func_name arg1 arg2 ... argN)

with args being literals, variables, or (expressions)
